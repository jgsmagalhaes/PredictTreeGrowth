# PredictTreeGrowth
### PredictingTreeGrowth is free and open-source application software written in Python 3.7 that was developed to allow easy and fast development of predictive models using the Recurrent Neural Network/Long Short Term Memory framework. RNNs have an upgraded architecture able to capture tree growth mechanisms related to time ordering and size dependence. The motivation for this App is to demystify the use of Machine Learning algorithms and allow accessibility of those methods by the scientific community. Its simple graphical user interface provides straightforward tools for building predictive models with the RNN algorithm. The use of this App can advance the adoption of Machine Learning algorithms in modelling individual tree growth. Our prototype version can be used by any person, including a non-expert in machine learning.
